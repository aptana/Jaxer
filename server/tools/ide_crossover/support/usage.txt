usage: DocGenCreator <options>* <javascript-file>+

    Standalone filenames will be treated as JavaScript files. All ScriptDoc-
    style comments will be processed and converted to the ScriptDoc XML format.
    Note that this version requires the use of @alias tags to specify the
    entire path to a given Class, Constructor, Method, or Property. ScriptDoc
    comments that do not have @alias tags will not generate output in the
    resulting XML output. All ScriptDoc XML content is sent to stdout unless
    the -o or --output-file option is specified.

    Many of the tags take effect at the point they are defined in the argument
    list. For example, setting a browser with -b will remain in effect until
    processing completes or another -b is defined on the command-line. In
    short, order is important. Some settings can be reversed using a leading
    '+' (or '++' for long-names) allowing that setting to be in effect for only
    a part of the command-line.

    Below are the options that are available on the DocGenCreator command-line

    -b, --browser
    --------------
    The name of the browser to associate with Classes, Constructors, Methods
    and Properties. Note that standalone files following -b (and -bv) will
    acquire that browser info. If another -b (and -bv) follows, then that new
    value will take effect on all files following that point. This allows for
    processing of multiple JavaScript files with varying user agent info.

    -bv, --browser-version
    ----------------------
    The version number of the browser to associate with Classes, Constructors,
    Methods, and Properties.

    -e, --extract
    -------------
    Extract all ScriptDoc comments (and the following line) and emit to stdout.
    
    -f, --filter
    ------------
    The name to be removed from the generated XML. Note that a 'startsWith' is
    used with this name against each type as it is being exported. If the type
    starts with the specified filter, then it will be excluded from the XML.
    You can remove entire namespaces and their children using the namespace or
    you can remove children only by ending the name with a period.

    -fp, --filter-private, +fp, ++filter-private
    --------------------------------------------
    Filter all members that are tagged as private. Note that this setting can
    be turned off with +fp or ++filter-private.

    -i, --import
    ------------
    Import one namespace into another. Note that types will be merged by adding
    types and members that do not exist in the target namespace. The parameter
    is in the following form: target=source where target is the namespace to
    import into and source is the namespace from which to import. Note that
    similar rules about namespace matches occur here as described in -f.

    -l, --show-locations, +l, ++show-locations
    ------------------------------------------
    Emit into the XML the file name or resource name and the offsets where a
    type is referenced. The locations are emitted as XML comments and precede
    the class element to which they refer. Note that this setting can be turned
    off with +l or ++show-locations.

    -o, --output-file
    -----------------
    The name of the file to which the resulting XML will be written. When this
    option is used, the result XML will not be emitted to stdout.

    -r, --resource
    --------------
    The name of the resource to process. This is used for testing only.

    -v, --verbose, +v, ++verbose
    ----------------------------
    Provide verbose output as files are being processed. Note that this setting
    can be turned off with +v or ++verbose.

    -w, --show-warnings, +w, ++show-warnings
    ----------------------------------------
    Show warnings for blocks that do not contain @alias tags. Note that blocks
    containing @classDefinition, @namespace, and @overview do not require
    @alias tags and will not be reported in the warning list. Note that this
    setting can be turned off with +w or ++show-warnings.
