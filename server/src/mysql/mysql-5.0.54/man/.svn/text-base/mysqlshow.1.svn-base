\fBmysqlshow [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcol_name\fR\fR\fB]]]\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBmysqlshow\fR
client can be used to quickly see which databases exist, their tables, or a table's columns or indexes.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
provides a command\-line interface to several SQL
SHOW
statements. See
Section\ 5.4, \(lqSHOW Syntax\(rq. The same information can be obtained by using those statements directly. For example, you can issue them from the
\fBmysql\fR
client program.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysqlshow\fR
like this:
.sp
.RS 3n
.nf
shell> \fBmysqlshow [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fIdb_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fItbl_name\fR\fR\fB [\fR\fB\fIcol_name\fR\fR\fB]]]\fR
.fi
.RE
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are shown.
.TP 3n
\(bu
If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in the table are shown.
.sp
.RE
.PP
The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or columns for which you have some privileges.
.PP
If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters (\(lq*\(rq,
\(lq?\(rq,
\(lq%\(rq, or
\(lq_\(rq), only those names that are matched by the wildcard are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should be escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a list of the proper tables or columns.
\(lq*\(rq
and
\(lq?\(rq
characters are converted into SQL
\(lq%\(rq
and
\(lq_\(rq
wildcard characters. This might cause some confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a
\(lq_\(rq
in the name, because in this case,
\fBmysqlshow\fR
shows you only the table names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an extra
\(lq%\(rq
last on the command line as a separate argument.
.PP
\fBmysqlshow\fR
supports the following options:
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-help\fR,
\fB\-?\fR
.sp
Display a help message and exit.
.TP 3n

\fB\-# [\fR\fB\fIdebug_options\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
Write a debugging log. The
\fIdebug_options\fR

.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-default\-character\-set=\fR\fB\fIcharset_name\fR\fR
.sp
Use
\fIcharset_name\fR
as the default character set. See
Section\ 2, \(lqThe Character Set Used for Data and Sorting\(rq.
.TP 3n
\(bu
\fB\-\-host=\fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR,
\fB\-h \fR\fB\fIhost_name\fR\fR
.sp

\fB\-p[\fR\fB\fIpassword\fR\fR\fB]\fR
.sp
The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the short option form (\fB\-p\fR), you
\fIcannot\fR
have a space between the option and the password. If you omit the
\fIpassword\fR
value following the
\fB\-\-password\fR
or
\fB\-p\fR
option on the command line, you are prompted for one.
.sp
Specifying a password on the command line should be considered insecure. See
Section\ 5.6, \(lqKeeping Your Password Secure\(rq.

\(bu
\fB\-\-status\fR,
\fB\-i\fR
