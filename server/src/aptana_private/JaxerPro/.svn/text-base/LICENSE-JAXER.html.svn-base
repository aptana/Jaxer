            If any provision of this Agreement or the application
            thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or unenforceable,
            the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision
            to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and to
            such end the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.
            In such event, the affected provision shall be amended to achieve as
            nearly as possible the same economic effect as the original provision.
            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee agrees that
            Section 10 (Limitation of Liability) will remain in effect
            notwithstanding the unenforceability of any provision in Section 9
            (Warranty).

            Aptana's rights and remedies for breach of this Agreement
            are cumulative. Licensee acknowledges that the Software contains
            valuable trade secrets and proprietary information of Aptana, that any
            actual or threatened breach of Section 4 will constitute immediate,
            irreparable harm to Aptana for which monetary damages would be an
            inadequate remedy, and that injunctive relief is an appropriate remedy
            for such breach.

            <b>11.9</b>

            writing signed authorized representatives on behalf of both parties.
            All waivers under this Agreement must be in writing, and any waiver or
            failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will
            not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or on any other occasion.
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
            with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all
            other prior and contemporaneous agreements and understandings both
            written and oral between the parties with respect to such subject
            matter. Without limiting the foregoing, this Agreement supersedes any
